This is a first person shooter game coded in godot that three other students and I worked on for a game jam. In this game the 
user is placed in an arena with randomly generated objects. The goal is to survive as long as you can. Enemies will spawn each round 
and it is up to the player to defeat them all. To advance to the next round the player must kill all the enemies that spawned in the round.
Each round the amount of enemies spawned increases by 5. 

The player spawns in with an automatic assault rifle that can hold thirty bullets. After they have fired all the bullets in the gun they can
press r to reload. The player does not have unlimited ammo and needs to pick it up once they run out. Ammo boxes spawn on the floor and give 
the player thirty bullets. The more ammo a player has the slower the player moves. The player can hold down the mouse button to fire all 
bullets in the chamber.
